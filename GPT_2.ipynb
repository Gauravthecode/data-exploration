            "The Emperor has previously interfered with this storyline with his return from space when, after an epic battle with the Time Queen, Luke Skywalker defeats the Time Lords and reveals that he's been replaced by an evil Force-hungry tyrant, the Emperor.\n",
            "Luke leaves the Force in an attempt to return to his own universe, only to fall victim to the mind control of his new \"super-human\" sidekick, Namor.\n",
            "He then gains a close personal friendship with an old foe, Professor X and departs the Star Tours show with his team, while Lady Fury plots to kill him.\n",
            "The next storyline reveals the Emperor has also interfered with the Star Wars storyline by altering the course of Star Wars history, altering the origin story of Solo into a parallel universe (with the former being changed into a parallel universe to him by Tarkin during the second intergalactic skirmish), altering the hero's identity from a minor hero to an Imperial super genius, altering his mind, and altering his identity as Solo in a series of secret orders.\n",
            "This final storyline also details a series of secret missions within Star Wars by members of the First Order.\n",
            "In the alternate realities, the Great One, General Hux and the Emperor, with Hux's intervention possibly being a foreshadowing, have been able to create \"World of Warcraft\".\n",
            "In the original version of the two-part series, Hux, who has been killed, becomes the sole surviving member of the Great One's organization, the Wildling.\n",
            "Before long, his body is discovered in the Savage Land, a vast and mystical jungle dominated by enormous monsters—one in which Hux was killed.\n",
            "Before he dies, Hux is buried at Mount Hymn of the Gods, and the other members, most notably the original Master Hix, turn on him.\n",
            "Some of the other member deaths are apparently due to Hux's fall from grace, though there is no indication what the cause was.\n",
            "The \"worlds of Warcraft\" storyline originally ran from December 20, 2010 until July 6, 2012.\n",
            "At the end of her tenure as the Great One, she publicly revealed the secret orders that kept her from becoming the next Great One, and the other members of the Great One were replaced with new members—including a third, seemingly self-appointed leader known only as the \"Great Mother\" who has recently escaped from Mount Hymn of the Gods.\n",
            "In 2013, Blizzard revealed that there would be much more to the World of Warcraft storyline.\n",
            "The official announcement that was made was in response to a question on Twitter about the decision by the team at CCP, Blizzard Entertainment, and Hux to change stories, and the team explain the current state of affairs in Star Wars, The West Wing universe and other Star Wars movies.\n",
            "Shortly after, a group of members of Star Wars Studios, including John Williams, shared a post on a popular Star Wars forum with a series of questions:\n",
            "How can Star Wars actors improve their story as they return from their own world of crime and chaos?\n",
            "What are the benefits of casting actors from Star Wars who have traveled throughout the galaxy and are still finding their footing, such as a \"bad guy\" who is able to control and manipulate his or her actions and powers while hiding those powers from others?\n",
            "Why should Star Wars actors be the target of a false flag attempt to manipulate the characters to their own ends, such as by creating a fictional world containing real Star Wars characters, and keeping his or her real friends, allies, enemies and worlds from him.\n",
            "What should actors do instead in a world that has not yet been created or is currently in a virtual or artificial state of affairs where all of the characters are actors who need to be killed to preserve their own stories and identities?\n",
            "While casting actors might be able to play actors, casting actors do not own Star Wars or the characters it casts, and actors who are acting with one is a false flag to be believed.\n",
            "This leaves a casting question: what is the benefit or lack of benefit of casting actors or the effects of casting actors on the characters, universe and characters that they create (e.g., as an acting character, a rogue who is able to cause chaos via his knowledge, power and influence, or as an intergalactic foe or hero)?\n",
            "It is clear that casting actors are able to create worlds that are never seen alive and that these worlds have many, many heroes.\n",
            "However, casting actors might well be willing to allow their own characters, environments and worlds to be changed in ways that allow their own characters to appear in ways that serve their own entertainment properties.\n",
            "Although Star Wars actors might be able to make their own world and characters that are realistic and realistic, casting directors would still have to use Star Wars technology and technology to make the world look good, because casts would not be able to produce actual \"worlds\" that would actually be\n",
